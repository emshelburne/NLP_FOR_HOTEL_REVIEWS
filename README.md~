NLP for Hotel Review Sentiment Analysis
This is a practice project in Natural Language Processing (NLP) focused on analyzing hotel reviews to understand what aspects of a hotel stay 
contribute to customer satisfaction. The dataset includes structured information (e.g., hotel location, stay duration) and unstructured text 
data (positive and negative reviews), with the target variable Reviewer_Score indicating sentiment (1 = positive, 0 = negative).

Project Workflow

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- [X] Loaded and explored the dataset to understand key features.

- [X] Cleaned and preprocessed text and numerical data.

- [X] Generated visualizations and summary statistics.

2. Text Preprocessing

- [X] Cleaned review text (tokenization, lowercasing, punctuation removal).

- [X] Used CountVectorizer to transform review texts separately for positive and negative columns.

- [X] Combined vectorized text with original numerical features for modeling.

3. Modeling and Evaluation

    a. Logistic Regression:

    - [X] Trained and evaluated on accuracy.

    - [X] Identified top 20 positive and negative words most predictive of sentiment.

    b. PCA + Decision Tree:

    - [X] Built using a pipeline with PCA, using 20 principal components.

    - [X] Tuned hyperparameters via 5-fold cross-validation.

    - [X] Compared performance with logistic regression.

    - [X] Evaluated best model using confusion matrix, precision, recall, and discussed model errors.


Objectives
Practice full NLP pipeline: from EDA to preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.

Identify review patterns and keywords associated with guest satisfaction.

Draw actionable insights from model outputs and performance metrics.
